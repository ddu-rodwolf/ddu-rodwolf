## Personal Projects & Contributions (Public, Private or In Progress)

- 🛰️ [**SIOS-InfraNOR-Ocean-Color**](https://github.com/ddu-rodwolf/SIOS-InfraNOR-Ocean-Color)  
  - Visualizes Arctic ocean color data (1 km resolution) to estimate **phytoplankton biomass** from **Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a)** observations around Svalbard.  
  - Demonstrates how to use remote sensing datasets in **netCDF** format under Python for environmental analysis — including spatial plotting and biomass proxy calculations.

- 🔧 **Python Object Explorer**  
  A CLI-based utility for recursive structural analysis of Python objects  
  This project provides a structured, richly formatted exploration of Python objects, suitable for researchers and developers working with unfamiliar libraries or dynamically generated code.  
  **Key features:**  
  - 🔍 Deep introspection of objects, classes, modules, and inheritance chains  
  - 🧩 Recursively traverses attributes and `__mro__`  
  - 🌈 Colored, indented, and grouped output via [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)  
  - 📚 Markdown export and optional file output for documentation or sharing  
  - 🧪 Usable within notebooks or as a shell utility  
  Originally developed as a personal research tool to complement RE workflows and ontology inspection tasks.  
  **Project status:** 🧪 Internal project, preparing for publication  
  **Tech stack:** 🔬 Python, `rich`, reflection tools, RE-friendly CLI
    
- 📤 [**Global-Riverine-N2O-Emissions-Processor**](https://github.com/ddu-rodwolf/Global-Riverine-N2O-Emissions)  
  Data processing pipeline in R to handle geospatial raster datasets from the CMS project on global nitrous oxide emissions (1900–2016).  
  **Key components:**  
  - Summarized annual raster stacks using two aggregation methods  
  - Geospatial filtering and masking using shapefiles (`sf`, `raster`, `rgdal`)  
  - Automated processing and visualization of GeoTIFF layers by stream order and emission category  
  - Output comparison of cumulative estimates as maps and GeoTIFFs  
  **Goal:** Gain hands-on experience with large raster datasets and automate N₂O emission analysis across decades.
    
- 🪿 **Arctic-Tern-Predators-Model** ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-private-inactive?color=gray)  
  Contribution to a collaborative project investigating predation risk of barnacle goose eggs based on nest location and parental defense behavior.  
  **Key methods:**  
  - Survival analysis with **Cox Proportional Hazards Models** (time-dependent covariates)  
  - Predator visitation modeled using **Zero-inflated Binomial GLMs**  
  - Model fitting via **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**; selection using **AIC**  
  - R packages used: `survival`, `survminer`, `optim`  
  **Focus:** Understanding how predator pressure varies with goose behavior and tern colony proximity.
