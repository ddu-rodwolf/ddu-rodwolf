## üëÄ Personal Projects & Contributions (Public, Private or In Progress)

- üîí **Arctic-Tern-Predators-Model**  ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-private-inactive?color=gray)
  Contribution to a collaborative project investigating predation risk of barnacle goose eggs based on nest location and parental defense behavior.  
  **Key methods:**  
  - Survival analysis with **Cox Proportional Hazards Models** (time-dependent covariates)  
  - Predator visitation modeled using **Zero-inflated Binomial GLMs**  
  - Model fitting via **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**; selection using **AIC**  
  - R packages used: `survival`, `survminer`, `optim`  
  **Focus:** Understanding how predator pressure varies with goose behavior and tern colony proximity.

- üì§ [**Global-Riverine-N2O-Emissions-Processor**](https://github.com/ddu-rodwolf/Global-Riverine-N2O-Emissions)  
  Data processing pipeline in R to handle geospatial raster datasets from the CMS project on global nitrous oxide emissions (1900‚Äì2016).  
  **Key components:**  
  - Summarized annual raster stacks using two aggregation methods  
  - Geospatial filtering and masking using shapefiles (`sf`, `raster`, `rgdal`)  
  - Automated processing and visualization of GeoTIFF layers by stream order and emission category  
  - Output comparison of cumulative estimates as maps and GeoTIFFs  
  **Goal:** Gain hands-on experience with large raster datasets and automate N‚ÇÇO emission analysis across decades.

‚û°Ô∏è More will be made public in the near future <!-- ‚Äî feel free to [get in touch](mailto:your.email@example.com) for details.
