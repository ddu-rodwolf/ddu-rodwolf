## 👀 Personal Projects & Contributions (Private or In Progress)

- 🔒 **Arctic-Tern-Predators-Model**  
  Contributed to a collaborative project investigating predation risk of barnacle goose eggs based on nest location and parental defense behavior.  
  **Key methods:**  
  - Survival analysis with **Cox Proportional Hazards Models** (time-dependent covariates)  
  - Predator visitation modeled using **Zero-inflated Binomial GLMs**  
  - Model fitting via **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**; selection using **AIC**  
  - R packages used: `survival`, `survminer`, `optim`  
  **Focus:** Understanding how predator pressure varies with goose behavior and tern colony proximity.
